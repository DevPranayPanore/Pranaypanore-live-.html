    1906: Henry Joseph Round discovered the principle of electroluminescence, where a solid-state diode emits light when
    an electrical current passes through it.<br>
    1927: Oleg Losev, a Soviet inventor, created a silicon carbide LED.

    <p>Introduction to LED (Light Emitting Diode) - The Engineering ...LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a semiconductor
        device that emits light when an electric current flows through it. It's a highly energy-efficient and versatile
        technology used in various applications, from lighting to displays and sensors.

    <p>There are various types of LEDs, including:<br>
        High-Power LEDs: Designed for applications requiring high brightness, such as floodlights and spotlights. <br>
        RGB LEDs: Allow for a wide range of colors by combining red, green, and blue LEDs. <br>
        Chip-on-Board (COB) LEDs: High-power LEDs that are mounted directly onto a circuit board. </p>

    <p>A white light LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a type of LED that emits light perceived by the human eye as white.
        Unlike traditional incandescent bulbs that naturally emit a broad spectrum of light, LEDs emit light in very
        narrow wavelengths. Therefore, producing white light from an LED typically involves a combination of methods to
        create the full visible spectrum.</p><br>
    1. Phosphor-Converted White LED (pc-LED)
    Most common method.

    A blue or near-UV LED is coated with a phosphor material (usually made from yttrium aluminum garnet doped with
    cerium â€” YAG:Ce).

    The blue LED excites the phosphor, which emits yellow light.

    The combination of blue (from the LED) and yellow (from the phosphor) light is perceived as white.

    Pros:

    Simpler, cheaper, and widely used in commercial lighting.

    High efficiency.

    Cons:

    Color rendering can be poor (i.e., not all colors appear natural under the light).

    2. RGB White LED
    Uses red, green, and blue LEDs mixed together to produce white light.

    Can be tuned to change color temperature or generate any color of light.

    Pros:

    More control over the color temperature and rendering.

    Used in display backlighting and decorative lighting.

    Cons:

    More complex control circuitry.

    May have lower luminous efficacy and stability compared to pc-LEDs.

    Applications
    General lighting (bulbs, street lights, office lighting)

    Flashlights

    Automotive headlights

    Backlighting for screens

    Medical lighting

    Decorative and architectural lighting
